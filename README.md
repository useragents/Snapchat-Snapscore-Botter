### How to use

`For Windows Users`

This program only works with Snapchat Web.

1. Install Python from <a href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.2/python-3.9.2-amd64.exe">here</a>. It is super important that checkbox `Add Python to PATH` is checked on setup.
2. After Python is installed, you need to install the required modules that are used for this script. 
3. Open the file called `Install Requirements.bat`. This will do everything for you with no issues, simple.
   
1. On your phone, open Snapchat, create a shortcut with as many people as possible to spam snaps to.
2. Download Snapchat Web on a Computer
3. Login and allow permissions to your Camera/Microphone/etc
4. If you don't have a camera, download OBS Studio and get a virtual camera.
5. You may need to restart PC if you only downloaded a virtual camera just now.
6. Open the `main.py` script with Python. Select the Start option and begin.
8. If you are confused, I am creating a YouTube tutorial that will be available soon.
